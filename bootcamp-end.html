										<h2><a href="#">My Journey at Tech Elevator: From Novice to Developer in 14 Weeks</a></h2>
										<p>After 14 weeks, my time at Tech Elevator has ended. Nows the time to take my new knowledge to the next stop in my career.</p>

								<p>The past 14 weeks at Tech Elevator have been an intense and transformative experience, marked by relentless learning, collaborative projects, and a deep dive into full-stack web development. I immersed myself in mastering the fundamentals and advanced concepts of Java and Spring Boot for back-end development, while also gaining proficiency in Vue.js to craft dynamic and responsive front-end applications. This bootcamp pushed me to my limits, but it also provided me with the tools, guidance, and support I needed to transition from a coding novice to a confident developer ready to tackle real-world challenges.</p>
								<p>One of the first major milestones in my journey was the development of a command-line vending machine application. This project, completed in collaboration with another aspiring developer, was a deep dive into object-oriented programming, file handling, and transaction management. It was a challenging but rewarding experience that solidified my understanding of Java and the importance of writing clean, maintainable code. Following this, we took on the task of creating a Venmo-like application, which not only tested our ability to manage user accounts and financial transactions securely but also introduced us to RESTful web services and API development using Spring Boot. </p>
								<p>The culmination of my time at Tech Elevator was a capstone project where I joined forces with three other developers to build a fully functional website for an animal shelter. This project was a comprehensive test of everything we had learnedâ€”from back-end architecture and database integration to front-end design and user experience. Working in a larger team added another layer of complexity, requiring us to manage version control, collaborate effectively, and merge our individual contributions into a cohesive final product. This experience was invaluable in preparing me for the collaborative nature of the software development industry.</p>
								<p>I am incredibly grateful to the Tech Elevator staff, especially my instructor, Andy, whose guidance and support were instrumental in my development. The camaraderie with my fellow students, all driven by the same passion for learning and growth, was a source of constant motivation. As I move forward in my career, I carry with me not only the technical skills I gained but also the invaluable experience of working closely with others to overcome challenges and deliver meaningful software solutions. Tech Elevator has truly been a launching pad, and I am excited to see where this journey takes me next.</p>
