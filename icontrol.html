                                <p>After graduating from UMBC in the summer of 2021 with a degree in Business Technology Administration, I was eager to dive into the professional world. I had a pretty clear idea of where I wanted to take my careerâ€”something in the realm of data analysis or a similar role where I could blend my love for technology and business. With my resume polished and ready, I reached out to a recruiter who was also a longtime friend, hoping he could help me navigate the job market.</p>
                                <p>At first, the roles that came my way weren't exactly what I had in mind, but then my friend sent me a job description that caught my attention. It was for a Product Analyst position at iControl Data Solutions, a tech company specializing in the Alcohol and Beverage industry. The role seemed like a perfect fit, aligning with my goals and offering a chance to work in a dynamic industry that piqued my interest.</p>
                                <p>The interview process was refreshingly smooth. I had a great conversation with the hiring manager, who made the role and the company sound even more appealing. The good vibes from the interview gave me a strong feeling about this opportunity, and I was thrilled when they quickly extended an offer. Before I knew it, I was starting my first post-college job on a 6-month contract, excited to prove myself.</p>
                                <p>In this role, I really got to sink my teeth into the data side of things. One of the first projects I tackled was enhancing the data processes, specifically focusing on how we used Universal Product Codes (UPCs). I worked on streamlining this process, which significantly increased our efficiency. I also took charge of data quality control, using Excel to minimize errors and ensure our retail product database was as accurate as possible. It was satisfying to see how my efforts directly impacted the team, saving time and reducing mistakes week after week.</p>
                                <p>Another key part of my job was ensuring the reliability of our POS system by diving deep into the data from our alcohol portfolio, which spanned across a massive network of partners. I also collaborated with major companies like CVS, RNDC, and Red Lobster, conducting extensive Excel analysis to expand our product data. This work not only doubled the availability of our data but also enriched our supply chain analytics, which was a huge win for the company.</p>
                                <p>The experience I gained during those six months was invaluable. By the time my contract was up, I was thrilled to be offered a full-time position with the company. This role not only marked the beginning of my professional journey but also solidified my passion for working with data in the tech industry.</p>
